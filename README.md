# SqeezeButtonPi Daemon

SqueezeButtonPi Daemon or sbpd is a controller tool to use buttons and rotary encoders to control an instance of SqueezeLite or SqueezePlay running on the same Raspberry Pi device in connection with a Logitech Media Server/Squeezebox Server instance.

Rotary encoders or rotary-push-encoders can be used for volume, buttons (and the push-function of a rotary encoder) can be used for play/pause, skip forward, skip back or toggle the power state.

Non-Option arguments.
At least one needs to be specified for the daemon to do anything useful

            edge: Optional. one of
                  1 - falling edge
                  2 - rising edge
                  0, 3 - both
    For buttons: 
        b,pin,CMD[,resist,pressed,CMD_LONG,long_time]
            "b" for "Button"
            pin: GPIO PIN numbers in BCM-notation
            CMD: Command. One of:
                   PLAY:   Play/pause
                   PREV:   Jump to previous track
                   NEXT:   Jump to next track
                   VOL+:   Increase volume
                   VOL-:   Decrease volume

## Security

One issue with this code is that since it uses WiringPi it needs to be run with root privileges.
This is not a particularly good idea given that it also communicates over the network so if you run this on the Raspberry Pi controlling your nuclear powerplant in the backyard I would at least advice against exposing it to the internet.
A better architecture would probably be to fork a separate process running with more limited user rights for the networking stuff.

## Limitations

### IPv6
In the current state, this will probably not work in IPv6-only networks.

### Server Switching

The controller will follow the player if you switch the player to a new server.
This might not work with a remote server but should be reliable in an IPv4 network

### Encoder Speed

Server commands are fed to the server using a very simple scheduler on the main thread. Up to 10 commands per second can be sent but since all requests are being sent synchronously this depends on the reaction speed of the server.
The result of this is that very fast command sequences can result in jumping volume levels and delayed volume changes.

### Multiple Players

Probably not a limitation on a Pi. Only a single instance of SqueezeLite should be running if autodetection is being used since the code only looks for the first connection on port 3483.
With more than one player the server being found will be random. In such a setup, manual server configuration will be required.

### Multiple Network Interfaces

The MAC address detection is borrowed from SqueezeLite so when running automatically the MAC found should be the same used by SqueezeLite.
If that's not the case in setups with more than one MAC or SqueezeLite uses a manually configured MAC manual MAC configuration should be used.

### MySqueezebox.com

This tool will only work with Logitech Media Server, it doesn't authenticate against MySqueezebox.com. While authentication against MySqueezebox.com should generally be possible for a controller it should be unneeded in this case because DIY and 3rd party players are not supposed to directly connect to MySqueezebox.com anyway and the design of this tool is to control a player running on the same device as this controller.
